# Error handling & Exceptions

- Assertions
- throw exceptions
- try, catch, finally, rethrow

## Errors vs Exceptions

### Errors

- Programmer mistake(we did something wrong)
- calling a function with invalid arguments, index out of bounds etc.
- Program should terminate immediately (not safe to recover)

### Exception

- Failure condition: something unexpected happened
- Unexpected: out of control
- Handle it(e.g. show message to user)  and recover
